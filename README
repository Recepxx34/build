This branch holds LUCI configuration for the Go project.

Regenerate configuration by running `./main.star`.

You will need the `lucicfg` program for that.
See https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools/#installing
to install it.

Configuration changes take effect within minutes of CL submission.
You can view the status at https://luci-config.appspot.com/#/projects/golang.
